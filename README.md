# City of Fort Wayne Greenways and Trails Department REST API (CRAPI) Overview

## POST Requests

For POST, all params are sent as a JSON object in the body of the request. These headers should contain `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Auth Token

After **POST login**, the server will send back an auth token. Clients should send this token when making ANY future requests so the server knows with which user it’s dealing. The headers for all other requests should contain it like `Trails-Api-Key: ab83920bdc826bdaf`

* HTTP 401: The auth token was not included in the request headers. For POST login, The username and password are incorrect.
* HTTP 419: The auth token is no longer (or never was) valid and should be re-obtained before making any more requests.
* HTTP 500: The server is at fault.

## Date Format
